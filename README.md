# Neon University Management System

This is a project I created in C++ as part of my Object Oriented Programming (CS217) course.

The system functionality is listed in NeON-Project.docx and a UML diagram of the classes is added as well. The system can register/unregister courses for students, check attendane and marks, while teachers and Head of Departments have the ability to assign courses, manage student marksheets and attendance and so forth. IT Managers can create and manage login accounts while Teacher Assistants (TA) can evaluate student quizzes and midterms while also being able to access student functionality. 

The program saves all the data to .txt files once the user logs out and then the program reads data from those updated files once the program starts.

Currently the main() is modified to directly take input from the file, but it can be modified to create new objects of teachers,students, courses and so forth. 

The following credentials can be used to test the system:

Student Login: 123456std
Student Password: 123456

Teacher Login: alpha1234
Teacher Password: 123456

HOD Login: hod123456
HOD Password: 123456

IT Manager Login: user12345
IT Manager Password: pw1234

Teacher Assistant Login: myTA12345
Teacher Assistant Password: 123456

I have utilized dynamic memory allocation using pointers and Object Oriented Programming concepts of classes, polymorphism, association, aggregation, composition, cascaded functions, virutal functions, inheritance, exception classes, template functions and much more.
